# Feature Specification: Add Items to Cart

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-items-to`  
**Created**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add Items to a cart. There are two use cases for this feature: 1) Given there is no cart, when an item is added, then a cart is created as a new aggregate and the item is added to the cart; 2) Given there are three items in a cart, when a new item is added, the command is rejected with an error "A cart cannot hold more than three (3) items.""

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Adding items to shopping cart with capacity constraints
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users adding items
   ‚Üí Actions: Add item, create cart, validate capacity
   ‚Üí Data: Cart, Items
   ‚Üí Constraints: Maximum 3 items per cart
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úì Item definition and duplicate handling clarified (Product ID + quantity increment)
   ‚Üí ‚úì Capacity overflow behavior clarified (reject entirely with error)
   ‚Üí ‚úì Concurrency handling clarified (optimistic locking)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows identified for cart creation and capacity validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement covers cart operations and business rules
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Cart and Item entities with their relationships
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úì All critical ambiguities resolved through clarification session
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: How should the system handle adding the same item multiple times to a cart? ‚Üí A: Increment quantity (combine same items into single entry with quantity field)
- Q: What identifies an item for the purpose of detecting duplicates and managing cart contents? ‚Üí A: Product ID (simple numeric or UUID identifier)
- Q: How should the 3-item limit be counted when items have quantities? ‚Üí A: Count total quantity (sum of all item quantities cannot exceed 3)
- Q: What should happen when a user tries to add an item that would exceed the cart capacity? ‚Üí A: Reject entirely (show error, don't add any of the item)
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent attempts to add items when the cart is near capacity? ‚Üí A: Optimistic locking (detect conflicts and retry with updated cart state)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a customer, I want to add items to my shopping cart so that I can collect products for purchase while browsing, with the system ensuring my cart doesn't exceed the maximum allowed capacity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no existing cart, **When** I add an item with quantity 1, **Then** a new cart is created and the item is added to it (total quantity: 1)
2. **Given** a cart with total quantity 1, **When** I add another item with quantity 1, **Then** the item is successfully added to the cart (total quantity: 2)
3. **Given** a cart with total quantity 2, **When** I add an item with quantity 1, **Then** the item is successfully added to the cart (total quantity: 3)
4. **Given** a cart with total quantity 3 (at capacity), **When** I attempt to add another item, **Then** the system rejects the request with error "A cart cannot hold more than three (3) items."
5. **Given** a cart with 1 item (quantity 2), **When** I add the same item again, **Then** the quantity is incremented to 3 and cart is at capacity
6. **Given** a cart with 1 item (quantity 2), **When** I add the same item again (which would make quantity 3), **Then** the item is successfully added, but adding again would be rejected
7. **Given** a cart with total quantity 2, **When** I attempt to add an item with quantity 2 (would exceed capacity), **Then** the system rejects the entire request with error "A cart cannot hold more than three (3) items." and no items are added
8. **Given** two concurrent operations on a cart with quantity 1, **When** both attempt to add items simultaneously, **Then** one succeeds and the other detects a conflict, requiring retry with the updated cart state

### Edge Cases
- When adding the same item multiple times, the system increments the quantity of the existing entry rather than creating duplicate entries
- When adding an item that would exceed capacity (e.g., adding quantity 2 to a cart with quantity 2), the entire operation is rejected with no partial additions
- Concurrent add operations use optimistic locking - if cart state changes between read and write, the operation detects the conflict and requires retry with fresh cart state
- Item availability changes after adding to cart are handled outside cart domain scope (future enhancement)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create a new cart automatically when a user adds their first item
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to add items to an existing cart up to the maximum capacity
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce a maximum limit of 3 total item quantities per cart (sum of all item quantities cannot exceed 3)
- **FR-004**: System MUST reject attempts to add items when cart is at capacity with the exact error message "A cart cannot hold more than three (3) items."
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist cart state between add operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST increment the quantity when the same item is added multiple times to a cart (no duplicate entries allowed)
- **FR-007**: System MUST use Product ID as the unique identifier for items when detecting duplicates and managing cart contents
- **FR-008**: System MUST reject add operations entirely when they would cause the total cart quantity to exceed 3, without adding any portion of the requested item
- **FR-009**: System MUST use optimistic locking to handle concurrent add operations, detecting conflicts when cart state has changed and requiring retry with updated state

### Key Entities
- **Cart**: Represents a collection of items for a user session, with a maximum total quantity of 3 across all items, maintains state across operations
- **Item**: Represents a product that can be added to a cart with an associated quantity, identified by a unique Product ID (numeric or UUID). Additional attributes (name, price, etc.) are not specified as they are not required for cart functionality.
