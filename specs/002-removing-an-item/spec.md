# Feature Specification: Remove Item from Cart

**Feature Branch**: `002-removing-an-item`  
**Created**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Removing an item from the cart. Given a cart, when a command to remove an item is received, then if the item is in the cart the quantity should be reduced by 1. If the item does not exist, then an error should be returned."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description provided: remove items from shopping cart
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: users with shopping carts
   ‚Üí Actions: remove item command, reduce quantity, return error
   ‚Üí Data: cart, items, quantities
   ‚Üí Constraints: item must exist in cart, quantity reduced by 1
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly specified in user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: command received ‚Üí quantity reduced OR error returned
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and derived from description
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Cart, items, quantities involved
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: What type of error should be returned when attempting to remove a non-existent item? ‚Üí A: Validation error (user correctable, cart unchanged)
- Q: How should the system identify items in remove commands? ‚Üí A: Product ID only (e.g., "PROD123")
- Q: What should happen when concurrent remove operations target the same item? ‚Üí A: Use eventstream version checks to resolve
- Q: What performance target should the system meet for remove operations? ‚Üí A: Under 100ms response time for 95% of operations
- Q: What should happen if a remove operation fails due to system error (not validation)? ‚Üí A: Fail immediately with system error message

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has items in their shopping cart and wants to remove one unit of a specific item. The system should decrease the item's quantity by one if the item exists, or inform the user if the item is not in their cart.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a cart containing 3 units of Product A, **When** a remove item command is received for Product A, **Then** the cart should contain 2 units of Product A
2. **Given** a cart containing 1 unit of Product B, **When** a remove item command is received for Product B, **Then** the cart should contain 0 units of Product B (item completely removed)
3. **Given** a cart that does not contain Product C, **When** a remove item command is received for Product C, **Then** an error should be returned indicating the item is not in the cart
4. **Given** an empty cart, **When** a remove item command is received for any product, **Then** an error should be returned indicating the item is not in the cart

### Edge Cases
- What happens when attempting to remove an item from an empty cart?
- How does the system handle removing the last unit of an item (quantity becomes 0)?
- What happens when the same remove command is issued multiple times in succession?
- How does the system handle concurrent remove operations on the same item using eventstream version checks?
- How does the system respond to system errors during remove operations (fails immediately with error message)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept remove item commands that specify a product ID to identify which product to remove from the cart
- **FR-002**: System MUST reduce the quantity of an item by exactly 1 when a remove command is processed for an existing item
- **FR-003**: System MUST completely remove an item from the cart when its quantity reaches 0 after a remove operation
- **FR-004**: System MUST return a validation error when a remove command is received for an item that does not exist in the cart, leaving the cart unchanged
- **FR-005**: System MUST return a validation error when a remove command is received for an empty cart, leaving the cart unchanged
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain cart state consistency after each remove operation
- **FR-007**: System MUST use eventstream version checks to resolve concurrent remove operations targeting the same item
- **FR-008**: System MUST fail immediately with a system error message when a remove operation encounters a system error (non-validation failure)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Cart**: Container that holds items and their quantities for a user session
- **Item**: Product or service that can be added to or removed from a cart, identified by a unique product ID (e.g., "PROD123")
- **Quantity**: Non-negative integer representing how many units of an item are in the cart

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST complete 95% of remove operations within 100ms response time
